When talking about ORM, most people are referring to a library that implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique, hence the phrase \"an ORM\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> An ORM library a completely ordinary library written in your language of choice that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data, so you don't use SQL anymore; you interact directly with an object in the same language you're using."

    "\n",
    "> - A lot of stuff is done automatically, from database handling to I18N.\n",
    "- It forces you to write MVC code, which, in the end, makes your code a little cleaner.\n",
    "- You don't have to write poorly-formed SQL (most Web programmers really suck at it, because SQL is treated like a \"sub\" language, when in reality it's a very powerful and complex one)\n",

    "- Performance is OK for usual queries, but a SQL master will always do better with his own SQL for big projects.\n",
    "- It abstracts the DB. While it's OK if you know what's happening behind the scene, it's a trap for new programmers that can write very greedy statements, like a heavy hit in a <b>`for`</b> loop."
