    "# Debugging and Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can start making apps, let's make sure our apps are working like it's supposed to. We'll look at two built in modules that let us do so: the logging and pdb modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Pdb](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/pdb.html#module-pdb)\n",
    "\n",
    "> _The module pdb defines an interactive source code debugger for Python programs. It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single stepping at the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source code listing, and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack frame. It also supports post-mortem debugging and can be called under program control._\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to use the debugger is just to insert the line __`import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`__ anywhere your code. This lets you step in at the point where this line is inserted via a pdb console. It's just a Python console. The execution of the program is suspended until the the keyword __`continue`__ is entered. There are other [debugger commands](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands) at your disposal but this will let you inspect your variables or any execution parameters to help you figure out any problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our `register()` function, `pdb` is imported before the `return` statement but it's commented out. Uncomment it and run the app."

There's also a small icon on the right most side of each line that gives you access to the debugger console after entering the PIN. The PIN is given in the console when the Flask server starts.\n",
