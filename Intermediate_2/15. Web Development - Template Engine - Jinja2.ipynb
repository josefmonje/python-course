    "We didn't import the Jinja2 module in our code directly since Flask takes care of this for us. The details of using the jinja2 module are hidden by Flask. We can focus on learning how the template works and the template language to create pages that our server will render.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the template's source code, it seems like normal HTML interspersed with odd braces that contain `{{ variables or expressions }}` and `{% statements %}`. Have a closer look at it. These are just some of the delimiters available in the template. Various statement __tags__ are available for use. We'll learn about those in a bit. The template language easy because it's similar to Python so there's only a few things to learn.\n",

    "## [Comments](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#comments)\n",

    "\n",
    "## [Variables](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "`flask.render_template()` accepts a template name and keyword arguments for the context. Those keyword arguments become your variables within the template. Variables can be of different types and can be manipulated like how you typically would in Python, with only a few additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Filters](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#builtin-filters)\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Variables can be modified by filters. Filters are separated from the variable by a pipe symbol (|) and may have optional arguments in parentheses. Multiple filters can be chained. The output of one filter is applied to the next._\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{{ name|striptags|title }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing attributes via dot ( `.` )\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lines do the same thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{{ foo.bar }}\n",
    "{{ foo['bar'] }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Expressions](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#expressions)\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Jinja allows basic expressions everywhere. These work very similarly to regular Python; even if you’re not working with Python you should feel comfortable with it._\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions in templates can accept most of the things you can do in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Literals\n",

    "\n",
    "## Base Template\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `{% block %}` tags define four blocks that child templates can fill in. All the block tag does is tell the template engine that a child template may override those placeholders in the template.\n",

    "\n",
    "The {% extends %} tag is the key here. It tells the template engine that this template “extends” another template. When the template system evaluates this template, it first locates the parent. The extends tag should be the first tag in the template. Everything before it is printed out normally and may cause confusion.\n",

    "> _Example taken from the documentation._\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of things here. We have two templates, `base.html` and `index.html`. In both templates, we have __`{% block %}`__ tags with their own names. Our child template, `index.html`, has an __`{% extends %}`__ tag. This tells Flask to look for the template with the specified name first, in this case, `base.html`, and that this template is an extension of that one. This is where the named __`{% blocks %}`__ come in. The content of the child template's block tags go into the base template's block tags with the same name. The child template inherits from the base template and fills in the blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Include](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#include)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to make a template reusable is to write the component in a separate file. This will __not__ use __`{% extend %}`__. Instead, the __`{% include %}`__ tag can be used in any other template. The specified template will be inserted into that template and have access to the variables within the current template's scope."
