    "# Introduction to Django\n",
    "\n",
    "The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of notebooks assumes that you already have a good knowledge of Python. Basic knowledge of using Flask or any other Python web development framework is also recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high level framework that wants to make web development faster by including many extras. Code that you would otherwise need to repeatedly write in most projects are already built as part of the framework. This is why you'd often read that it has \"batteries included\". For many other things, there are Django packages available to easily plug into your application. With the way django apps are structured, it encourages reusability. These are just some of the things that help make developing with Django fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning curve will be steep so a good knowledge of Python before learning Django would be appropriate. Knowledge of Flask or any other framework is recommended for familiarity with basic web development. We'll try to cover everything in between but there's a lot more to learn so getting the basics out of the way would let us learn about Django itself faster. This set of notebooks focuses on the basics, the bare minimum so you could get an understanding and start using Django. The \"extras\" and Django packages won't be covered here yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction takes a top-down approach, explaining the \"big idea\" before writing any code. Other tutorials are available if you like learning by coding first. We recommend the [Django girls tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html) because it doesn't assume anything and takes good care to explain every step. You can skip parts if you feel like it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Django Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be useful to learn about terms used in Django to help us have a common way to talk about things. When developing with Django, the collection of all the packages you'll be writing is called a __`project`__. A project is divided into many parts called __`apps`__ which does something specific relative to your app. Let's say you're developing a concept for an online service called \"Google\". You'll have a folder called __`google/`__ and your __`apps`__ inside in it. You'll have an app for handling account related concerns like logging in/out, signing up, etc. in a folder called __`account/`__. There's also a __`search/`__ folder handling part of the service dedicated to searches. There's also a __`maps/`__ folder, and so on. This is how a Django project is structured - a __`project`__ is divided into __`apps`__.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Project\n",
    "* App\n",
    "\n",
    "### MVC\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Django app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. In your __`account/`__ folder, there's a __`models.py`__ file where all the classes related to accounts are defined. There's a __`views.py`__ file, which is actually the controller where all your business logic related to accounts reside. The template is your view. This is the __`*.html`__ file, which is normal HTML plus Django template tags. There's also a __`urls.py`__ file that lets you map out your controllers to URL addresses. Django has a built-in admin functionality that lets you quickly test your models without having to build views and controllers. All you have to do is register your models to the admin using the __`admin.py`__ file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files or folders are not restricted to this list. In fact, you can create any file or folder but be aware that there are some conventions. Some files or folders may also be created when certain commands are executed like when creating model migrations, a __`migrations/`__ folder is created containing migration scripts. Django apps will have most of these elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Django looks for templates in several ways. One of Django's behaviors is to look for them in a __`templates/`__ folder within each app. This behavior can be turned off by setting `'APP_DIRS': False` in the `TEMPLATES` list in the `settings.py` file. Another way is by specifying a list of paths in the `DIRS` key and Django will include those in its search.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "TEMPLATES = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n",
    "        'APP_DIRS': True,\n",
    "    },\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another folder with the name of your project with a different set of files. Specifically, it has __`settings.py`__, __`urls.py`__ and __`wsgi.py`__. We'll talk about the details of the project package folder later but these are most of what you can expect in an app folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "* models.py\n",
    "* views.py\n",
    "* urls.py\n",
    "* admin.py\n",
    "* templates/\n",
    "* migrations/\n",
    "* etc.\n",

    "## Management Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually following all of this is tedious and error-prone. The good thing is that Django has management commands to help us with this repetitive task. It will be good to first learn some of the more commonly used management commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Django is installed, it also installs a script that can be run from anywhere. This is the `django-admin` script that lets you run Django management commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Django\n",
