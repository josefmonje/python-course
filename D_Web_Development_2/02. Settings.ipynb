    "Before going straight to the code, this is a good time to mention that it will be good to familiarize yourself with the settings. The __`settings.py`__ file is where Django stores project configuration. There are a lot of available settings within Django. Some third party packges require some variables to be set for them to work properly. Most of these settings have defaults that don't need to be changed, some you might want to change, and some you'll need to change. Knowing how to configure your project can save you from some bugs and help you deploy your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a Python script so it needs to follow the proper syntax. You can set values in any way that's acceptable in Python. It can import values from other modules so settings can be structured in a way that you can have a `development.py` and `production.py` that both inherit from `base.py` but have their own environment-specific settings. If you'll be using a different filename besides the default `settings.py`, change the default value for `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` in `wsgi.py` which refers to 'project_name.settings'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/) for a complete reference on the settings. Below are some of the common ones you'll often encounter.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`os.path` lets you build paths that work across platforms. This is used in several places that refer to local paths like:\n",

    "Django looks for templates in several ways. One of Django's behaviors is to look for them in a __`templates/`__ folder within an app. This behavior can be turned off by setting `'APP_DIRS': False` in the `TEMPLATES` list in the `settings.py` file. Another way is by specifying a list of paths in the `DIRS` key and Django will include those in its search. It's up to you to decide where to put templates and the configuration allows you to do what you want.\n",
