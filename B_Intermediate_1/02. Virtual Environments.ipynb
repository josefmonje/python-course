    "\n",
    "A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to develop an app using the latest version of Django while also maintaining another app which requires a specific older version of Django, you'll see why virtual environments are important. Packages add and remove functionality depending on versions. Virtual environments will make your life easier by creating a space that isolates dependencies. You can activate or deactivate an environment to turn those dependencies on or off. Packages installed in a virtual environment stay in that environment. This way, you may happily create and maintain your apps without installing and reinstalling dependencies for each project. Basically, it keeps your global site-packages clean and manageable.\n",
