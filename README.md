Welcome to our Python Course Notebooks. These are a set of FREE interactive notebook tutorials for anyone interested to learn the Python programming language. The notebooks include interactive code and exercises from beginner up to advanced level, plus tutorials on Flask and Django web development frameworks.

You are welcome to use these notebooks whether you are new to programming or just new to Python. Become the software engineer you always wanted to be!

We welcome pull requests! We'll also appreciate if you give the repository a star :)

You have two options in accessing the notebooks:

## OPTION 1: GO TO THE COURSE WEBSITE

You will be redirected to your own Python Course server. Choose a course, and you're ready to go. This is recommended for beginners because no installations are necessary.

Course servers are __temporary__. Every few minutes, idle servers are disposed and a new one is made to replace it.

Course servers are __limited__. We monitor and adjust the capacity of the service. Right now it's capacity is set to 25 users.

## OPTION 2: CLONE OUR GITHUB REPOSITORY

There are a few prerequisites: 
* Git
* Python 3
* Pip
* Jupyter

This may take a few minutes to set up, but the good thing about this option is that you're going to have a copy of the notebooks on your own computer. That means you'll be able to save your progress unlike the web version. This is recommended for more experienced users.

## Python

There are 2 versions of Python, Python 2 and Python 3. __We'll use Python 3__.

If you don't have __Python 3__ installed yet, please download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

You can check if Python is installed by typing `python` in the command line. If it goes to the Python interpreter, then you already have Python installed. You can check the version from the very first line after your command. You should see something like:

```
Python 3.5.1 (default, Dec  7 2015, 11:24:55)
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

This says the Python version used is 3.5.1.


## Pip

If you already have Python installed, make sure you have the python package manager, __pip__. If you need to install pip, just follow the instructions from the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

You can check if pip is installed by typing `pip` in the command line. If it gives you the help screen, then you already have pip:

```
Usage:   
  pip <command> [options]

Commands:
...
```

If you have both versions of Python installed, the `pip` command installs for your default installation. You can use the `pip3` command to make sure you're installing it for Python 3.


## Jupyter

Then just `pip3 install jupyter`. Please refer to the [Jupyter documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#using-pip) if you encounter any problems.

> __Note:__
> Some of Jupyterâ€™s dependencies may require compilation, in which case you would need the ability to compile Python C-extensions. This means a C compiler and the Python headers. On Debian-based systems (e.g. Ubuntu), you can get this with:
> `apt-get install build-essential python3-dev`
> And on Fedora-based systems (e.g. Red Hat, CentOS):
> `yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'`
> `yum install python3-devel`
> (Use python instead of python3 for legacy Python 2.)


## Git

We assume you already have `git` installed. Just in case you don't, please refer to the instructions in the [Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Once you already have Jupyter installed, you just need to clone this repository by typing:

`git clone https://github.com/KLabCyscorpions/TrainingNotebooks.git`

Enter your github credentials when asked and you should have a local copy of the repository. 

## Notebook

To open the notebooks, just type `jupyter notebook`. You should be redirected to a browser page with links to folders of training notebooks.

Browse the TrainingNotebooks subdirectories. Notebooks have a `.ipynb` extension.

Topics are arranged in order.

While the notebooks are viewable in GitHub, you are encouraged to clone the repo locally and play with the code. :)

Have fun! :)
